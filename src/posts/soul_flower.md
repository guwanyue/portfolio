This series is inspired by female body structure, the designer's pursuit of human sensory experience. Combining privacy and security, the female image is explored in terms of women's physical and inner beauty. The light and thin organza fabric is used to express the softness and delicacy of women, and through a recreation of textile, a rich clothing structure is built.
