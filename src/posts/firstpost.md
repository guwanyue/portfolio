I like to explore different materials. Expanding foam is a difficult material to control, like cream on dessert, but its randomness makes it a lot of fun.

Eating sweets can be pleasant, even if it makes us bloated and sick. Controlling our appetite can keep us healthy and active for long-term happiness. Don't take life so seriously. To feel the beauty of life.

The series for this collection was that I wanted to be happy when I saw it. Imagine me taking a bite of dessert, letting the insulin increase quickly, and having a good mood.
