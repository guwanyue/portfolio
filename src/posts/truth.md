Based on the analysis of the research results, I found that self-traits exploration is more like an empirical exploration. After people have a certain understanding of their own personality traits, they are prone to freely combining those modules that accord with their own personality traits, and they will constantly update their self-cognition so as to create a pendant that can truly express their own personality.

In this way, I desire to help people explore their own personality traits, form proper self-cognition, and better express
themselves.
